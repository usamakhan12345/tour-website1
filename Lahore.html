    <p>The Badshahi Mosque   is a Mughal-era congregational mosque in Lahore, capital of the Pakistani province of Punjab. The mosque is located west of Lahore Fort along the outskirts of the Walled City of Lahore, and is widely considered to be one of Lahore's most iconic landmarks.
    The Badshahi Mosque was constructed by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb between 1671 and 1673 and was the largest mosque in the world from 1673 to 1986. The mosque is an important example of Mughal architecture, with an exterior that is decorated with carved red sandstone with marble inlay. It remains the largest mosque of the Mughal-era, and is the third-largest mosque in Pakistan.[4] After the fall of the Mughal Empire, the mosque was used as a garrison by the British Empire, and is now one of Pakistan's most iconic sights.

    <p>The Shalimar Gardens are a gorgeous Mughal garden situated in Lahore. The architecture of the garden is inspired by Persian and Arabic culture. Shah Jahan, the Mughal emperor laid the foundation of the garden for his beloved wife Noor Jahan in 1641.

        Not to mention that Shalimar Gardens were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981. Interestingly, there are 410 water fountains in the garden, made up of high-quality marble. The whole water system and architectural structure are so complex that even today architects are unable to fully understand the blueprint of the structure. Apart from fountains, there are five water cascades in the garden as well which give extra beauty to the place. To unwind and relax with your friends and family, we suggest you visit water parks in Karachi.</p>
